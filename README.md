# Login-Signup Design: A Comprehensive React Practice Project

## Overview

This is a React project aimed at practicing fundamental concepts such as initial setup, component design, state management, and user interactions. The application simulates a login-signup interface where users can log in or sign up for an account.

### Learning Objectives:

- Implement React components using a functional approach
- Design and layout components for user interfaces
- Manage state with React hooks (useState)
- Handle user interactions such as form submissions and validation
- Render UI conditionally based on authentication state

### Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/pritesh-git/login-signup-design.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd login-signup-design
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

### Running the Application:

1. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start  # or yarn start
   ```
2. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Customization and Further Development:

Feel free to experiment with the codebase, explore new design patterns, or add features to the login-signup application. You could enhance it by adding form validation, integrating with authentication APIs, or improving the user experience with animations.
